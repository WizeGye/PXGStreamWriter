<H1>RIFF File Structure</H1>
<P>The Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) is a tagged-file specification 
designed for the storage of multimedia data. Data types ranging from C++ objects 
to full-motion video can be stored based on the RIFF specification, and new data 
types can be added. 
<P>The zip file <A 
href="http://www.udayton.edu/~cps/faculty/jloomis/cps592B/asgn/asgn1/riff.zip">riff.zip</A> 
contains several examples of RIFF files, a Microsoft-provided executable program 
for displaying RIFF file structures, and a simple C++ program that also displays 
RIFF file chunks. 
<P>Table 1 shows several file formats based on the RIFF specification.

<P>RIFF provides a standard storage method for different types of multimedia 
data. Applications can ignore types of data in a RIFF file that they can't 
process, preventing software from becoming obsolete because of the introduction 
of a new variation of a data type. The specification's only major limitation is 
that, in its current version, the data area of a RIFF file may not exceed four 
gigabytes. Given the current state of the art of most PCs, this limitation isn't 
serious, but it may become so in a future that promises giant files such as 
those of full-length digital HDTV movies. Already, four gigabytes will only hold 
a few hours of uncompressed CD-quality audio. 
<H2>RIFF Internals </H2>
<P>The basis of the RIFF specification is a data structure known as the "chunk," 
which contains a unique chunk-type identifier, an integer value that holds the 
size of the chunk's data area and the data itself. 
<P>The following C data structures describes the organization of a chunk. <PRE>typedef unsigned long DWORD; 
typedef unsigned char BYTE; 
typedef DWORD FOURCC;    // Four-character code 
typedef struct { 
     FOURCC ckID;        // The unique chunk identifier 
     DWORD ckSize;       // The size of field &lt;ckData&gt; 
     BYTE ckData[ckSize];     // The actual data of the chunk 
} CK; 
</PRE>
<P align=center><IMG src="RIFF File Structure_files/riff1.gif"> 
<P>RIFF and LIST chunks have an extra field at the beginning of their data area. 
<PRE> 
typedef struct { 
     FOURCC ckID; 
     DWORD ckSize; 
     union { 
          FOURCC fccType;          // RIFF form type 
          BYTE ckData[ckSize]; 
     } ckData; 
} RIFFCK;
</PRE>
<P align=center><IMG src="RIFF File Structure_files/riff2.gif"> 
<P>These examples assume that there is no padding between fields in either 
structure. Therefore, chunk data in a non-RIFF or LIST chunk starts at an offset 
of 8 bytes into the chunk (12 bytes in the case of RIFF or LIST chunks). Chunks 
are padded at the end to WORD (16-bit) boundaries, however. 
<P>Chunks contain data such as ASCII text, waveform data, or bitmaps; certain 
chunks (currently only RIFF or LIST chunks) may contain nested subchunks. The 
data-area size includes the size of these subchunks (if any). By splitting a 
file into several variable-length chunks, RIFF allows for greater flexibility 
than file formats defined around fixed-length and position fields. 
<P>The first chunk in a RIFF file must be a RIFF chunk with a chunk ID 
consisting of the four-character code RIFF. The first chunk may alternatively be 
a RIFX chunk--the X indicates that all integers in the file are in Motorola 
format. In the present version of the RIFF specification, only one RIFF or RIFX 
chunk is allowed per file. 
<P>The RIFF chunk contains at least one other chunk, with the number of chunks 
varying depending on the form type (file format) of the file and on the number 
of optional chunks that are present in the file. These chunks are known as 
"subchunks" of the RIFF chunk. 
<P>RIFF chunks have a special code at the start of the data area that specifies 
the form type--the type of data in the file and its format. A RIFF form is also 
defined by: 
<P>
<UL>
  <P>
  <LI>A list of mandatory chunks (which must be present to make up a valid file 
  of the aforementioned form type). 
  <P></P>
  <LI>A list of optional chunks, some or all of which may be present. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Optionally, an order in which to store some or all of the chunks. </LI></UL>
<H2>LIST Chunks</H2>
<P>LIST chunks are the only chunks apart from RIFF chunks that may contain their 
own subchunks (although this may change). LIST chunks are usually subchunks of 
RIFF chunks themselves. Like RIFF chunks, LIST chunks have a four-character code 
in the first four bytes of their data area. This code specifies the list type 
(analogous to a RIFF chunk's form type) of the LIST chunk. 
<P>For example, a LIST chunk of list type INFO may contain subchunks such as 
INAM (the name of the data stored in the file) and ICRD (creation date). LIST 
chunks of type INFO are optional in current RIFF forms, but their use is 
recommended. The LIST chunks' subchunks can store much more information about 
the file than is available from the filename and date stamp. These LIST 
subchunks share a common format: Each contains one ASCIIZ (NULL terminated) 
string. 
<P>As long as LIST chunks are stored in the correct place (according to the 
applicable RIFF form), correctly written applications that cannot process LIST 
chunks will ignore their presence. Table 2 describes the layout of a typical 
RIFF file containing a LIST chunk. The table shows the layout of a simple WAVE 
form file as stored on disk. The "fmt" and "data" chunks are subchunks of the 
RIFF chunk.
